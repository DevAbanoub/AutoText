# Speech To Text Application on Android
Start the Speech-To-Text service from Google, then convert voice into text, the share it back to our Android app.

I provided only main files, which are:
1. MainActivity.java
2. activity_main.xml

Do not forget to include this statement in `Manifest.xml` file.
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```
